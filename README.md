# Hello, there!

My main interest is in the translation of biomedical research ðŸ§  into clinicals applications ðŸ©º  

Up to this day, I have worked on multiple projects in the field of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) aimed at restoring movement ðŸ’ªðŸ¦µ and vital functions such as blood pressure for individuals with spinal cord injuries.
