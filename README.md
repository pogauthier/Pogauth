Hi, I’m Pierre-Olivier Gauthier

I am interested in the translation of neuroscience research 🧠 into clinicals applications 🩺  

Up to this day, I have worked on multiples projects in the field of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for the 
restoration of mouvements 💪🦵 and vitals functions such as blood pressure 🩸 in the context of Spinal Cord Injury.
