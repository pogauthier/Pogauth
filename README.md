Hi, I’m Pierre-Olivier Gauthier B.Sc Honor in Neurosciences
I am interested in the translation of neuroscience research into clinicals applications.

Up to this day, I have worked on multiple projects in the field of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for the
restoration of mouvements and vitals functions such as blood pressure in the context of Spinal Cord Injury.
