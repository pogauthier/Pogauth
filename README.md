# Hello, there!

My main interest is in the translation of neuroscience research ðŸ§  into clinicals applications ðŸ©º  

Up to this day, I have worked on multiple projects in the field of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) aimed at restoring movement ðŸ’ªðŸ¦µ and vital functions such as blood pressure for individuals with spinal cord injuries.

I am currently a Research Intern in Dr. Aaron Phillips' laboratory at the Cummings School of Medicine, University of Calgary. In this lab, we focus on understanding the mechanisms underlying neurovascular regulation in the brain and developing neurostimulation therapies to treat autonomic dysfunction in human.
